### Problem

<p>Alfi asked Roy to go for shopping with her. Witty Roy came up with a condition. He said, for each product of MRP (Maximum Retail Price) <strong>R</strong>, she'll have to pay minimum of all the prime factors of R and he himself will pay rest of the amount. Without giving it a second thought Alfi agreed.</p>
<p>Now they bought <strong>N</strong> number of products. You're to find how much money did Roy had to pay for each product.</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<p>First line will contain integer <strong>N</strong>, number of products they bought.</p>
<p>Next N lines each will contain <strong>R</strong>, MRP of each product.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<p>Print single integer in a new line, the amount of money Roy had to pay for each product.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<p>2&lt;=<strong>N,R</strong>&lt;=1000000</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Large I/O. Be careful with certain languages.</p>

### Explanation

<p>Test Case #1: Only 1 prime factor of 5 is 5 itself, so Alfi will pay all the money and hence Roy has to pay 0.</p>
<p>Test Case #2: Prime Factors of 10 are 2 and 5, minimum of these is 2, so Alfi pays 2 and hence Roy has to pay the rest, which is 8.</p>
