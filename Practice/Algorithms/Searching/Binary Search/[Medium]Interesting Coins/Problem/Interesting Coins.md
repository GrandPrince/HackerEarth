### Problem

<p>Roy has a number of coins with him that he loves playing with by arranging them in the form of N stacks numbered sequentially. Lucy now gives him a task to make his arrangement of coins even more interesting. The arrangement will be interesting if the number of coins in the stacks are in strictly increasing order.</p>
<p>For this task Lucy gives Roy the option to modify his arrangement by increasing or decreasing the number of coins in each of the stack by atmost C coins. Also the number of coins in a stack should not fall below 1.</p>
<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to report the minimum C that helps Roy complete the assigned task.</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong><br>
First line contains T, the number of test cases</p>
<p>Each test case contains two lines. The first line has a single integer N. The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the number of coins in the stacks initially.</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong><br>
A single line for each test case containing the answer as explained in the statement.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints</strong><br>
1 &lt;= T &lt;= 200<br>
2 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000<br>
The number of coins initially in each of the stack is between 1 and 1000000000.</p>
